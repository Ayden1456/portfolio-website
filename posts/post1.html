            <p class="mt-3">It is an interesting time to be alive.
                Now more than ever, technology is making new ideas easier to execute than before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've read some thoughts by James Altucher on becoming an Idea Machineüí°
            </p>

            <p>So what does he advocate? And what does becoming an idea muscle even mean?

                Well, it all starts off with a <a class="a_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/">DAILY
                    PRACTICE</a>
            </p>

            <p>What are the key aspects of this daily practice?</p>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stick to 3 simple goals
                    <ul>
                        <li>"I want to be happy"</li>
                        <li>"I want to eradicate unhappiness in my life."</li>
                        <li>"I want every day to be as smooth as possible. No hassles."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            </p>


            <p> He breaks down his life into 4 key pillars
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="blog-p mb-3" style="line-height: 2;">Physical: James believes in the
                    significance of regular exercise for health. He used to play basketball every morning in 2003 and
                    now practices yoga. His suggestion is a minimum of 20-30 minutes of exercise daily, not necessarily
                    to build muscles but to maintain good health. He underscores that health is a precursor to happiness
                    and suggests habits like waking up early, sleeping by 9 p.m., and not eating after 5:30 p.m.
                </li>
                <li class="blog-p mb-3" style="line-height: 2;">Emotional: Emotionally, James
                    prioritizes his own well-being by distancing himself from negative influences, regardless of their
                    relation to him. He doesn't hesitate to cut ties with those who drain him and emphasizes the value
                    of honesty in daily life. He strongly believes in not overextending oneself, such as his personal
                    rule against attending weddings.
                </li>
                <li class="blog-p mb-3" style="line-height: 2;">Mental: On the mental front, James
                    champions the daily habit of idea generation. He likens the "idea muscle" to any other muscle that
                    can atrophy without use. He shares his practices, like listing alternatives to traditional education
                    and coming up with business ideas. According to him, it takes 3-6 months to build the idea muscle
                    after it atrophies.
                </li>
                <li class="blog-p mb-3" style="line-height: 2;">Spiritual: Spirituality, for James, isn't tied to
                    religion
                    but is about gratitude, meditation, forgiveness, and study. He finds solace in prayers, regardless
                    of religious affiliation, emphasizes short meditation sessions, and believes in daily gratitude
                    exercises.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div>

                James outlines the transformative timeline of his holistic practices:

                <p>
                    One Month:
                    Notices coincidences occurring more frequently.
                    Begins to feel luckier.
                    Observes more people smiling at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three Months:

                    Ideas start pouring in with intensity.
                    Feels a compelling urge to bring these ideas to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Six Months:

                    Quality of ideas improve.
                    Starts actively executing these ideas.
                    Receives assistance and support from others in realizing these ideas.
                    One Year:

                    Experiences a total transformation in his life compared to the previous year, including financial
                    improvements, better luck, and enhanced health.
                </p>


                <p>
                    It makes sense that this practice works -- however, it is quite a different way of thinking.
                    Exercising all muscles, from inside to outside will make a person stronger in all possible ways.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="mt-4 pt-3" style="border-top: #164D56 solid 1px;">
                So now that we've gone through the daily practice, what does being an idea machine look/feel like?

                A person who is an idea machine can come up with decent ideas in any scenario.
                This is especially helpful when they are in trouble, or when things aren't going their way.

                Here's the <a class="a_link"
                    href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">Full
                    Guide</a> for becoming an idea machine.

                I merely scratched the surface of becoming an idea machine with the daily practice I outlined above.

                It's kind of like a super power, and I want it. Both for me, and those around me.
